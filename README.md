# Hasmonean Coin Letter & Ruler Detection
This project B.Sc project with Israel's Antiquities Authority investigates the use of deep learning for automating the identification of inscriptions on Hasmonean coins. Initially, YOLO-based models were applied to detect and classify individual letters, with the dataset refined through repeated experiments. The letter data was then used to train a secondary model to classify the ruling Hasmonean leader associated with each coin. We evaluated several machine learning algorithms, including k-NN, Random Forest, SVM, MLP, and XGBoost, for this task. The results showed high accuracy, providing a strong foundation for applying object detection models to ancient coins and setting the stage for further research and optimization.
